# Room Occupancy Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts room occupancy based on sensor data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to improve energy efficiency in buildings by dynamically adjusting heating, lighting, and cooling based on occupancy status.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and sensor data analysis
- Machine learning model development and evaluation
- Model interpretability and visualization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of sensor readings such as:

- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Light Levels**
- **CO2 Levels**
- **Occupancy Status**

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC score. The best model provides reliable predictions for room occupancy.
